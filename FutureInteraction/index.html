						<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
						<p>Nowadays new products are appearing in the business of electronic devices and IT technologies 
						with an amazing speed and frequency, progress does not stop and it is not far off when innovative 
						devices of imagination, will become part of everyday life. The following adjacent interconnected 
						technologies are already becoming insanely popular: <b>Virtual Reality (VR)</b>, <b>Augmented Reality (AR)</b>, 
						and <b>Mixed Reality (MR)</b>. The two distinctive characteristics of those three “realities” are how 
						deep is the feeling of immersion in the virtual place and a unique way of interaction with it.</p>

										<h3><b>Augmented Reality</b></h3>
									</header>
									<p>Live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose 
									elements are ‘augmented’ by computer-generated or extracted real-world 
									sensory input such as sound, video, or graphics. It is related to 
									a more general concept called computer-mediated reality, in which a view of 
									reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a 
									computer.</p>

										<h3><b>Virtual Reality</b></h3>
									</header>
									<p>Computer technology that uses virtual reality headsets, sometimes in 
									combination with physical spaces or multi-projected environments to 
									generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user’s 
									physical presence in a virtual environment. Person using 
									virtual reality equipment is able to interact with virtual features or items.</p>

									<header>
										<h3><b>Mixed Reality</b></h3>
									</header>
									<p>Merge of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and 
									visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in 
									real time. Mixed reality takes place not only in the physical world or the 
									virtual world, but is a mix of reality and virtual reality, encompassing both 
									augmented reality and augmented virtuality.</p>

						<h2><b>Real-World Virtual Workspace</b></h2>
						<p>Bringing together multiple mixed reality devices in a shared space will open up new 
						collaboration options. With mixed reality, team members can be networked into a shared 
						virtual world overlaying the physical. <br/>
						In this connected environment, they can collaboratively work together on the virtual objects 
						and have the items interact with each other and the real word. </p>  <br/>

								<center><h3><b>How It Happen?</b></h3></center>
								<h4><b>Image Recognition</b></h4>
								<p>The ability of a computer system to quickly and precisely analyze an image and identify features within it.</p>
								<p>Mixed reality, however, needs to use more advanced image recognition to conduct object recognition to identify 
								walls, floors, tables and other objects dynamically for a worker to interact with.</p>
								
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<h4><b>Simultaneous Location And Mapping (SLAM)</b></h4>
								<p>A suite of technologies geared toward locating a person and mapping the environment concurrently.</p>
								<p>SLAM is key to mixed reality applications. To function in new, unknown or changing environments, the 
								technology needs to both continuously create a map of those environments and then locate and track a 
								person’s movement within them. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<center><h3><b>Benefits</b></h3></center>
								<p>Real-World Virtual Workspace allow us to work using virtual environtment,
								not physical environtment. So, we can reconstruct or do revision our works
								without wasting the physical source. Furthermore, it can allow us to work 
								together with other person when not in the same place. This will save a lot of time
								because we don't need to meet while working.</p>
